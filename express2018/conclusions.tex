% \finish{discuss multiple equations/contractions} 

% The formalisation of multi-variable context (or expressions) and the version of
% ``unique solutions'' theorems with multiple equations/contractions, is
% a relative hard problem. To the best of our knowledge, so far there's no formalization (in any kind of
% process calculi) touching these areas yet. However, we've made a few initial steps
% of this interesting problem.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{s:concl}

We believe that, beside the discovery of the rooted contraction $\rcontr$
with a more elegant unique solution theorem,
our CCS formalisation in HOL4 has also
provided a solid formal framework for future theoretical developments in
Concurrency Theory, particularily for process algebras like CCS. It's
easily understandable, with statements extremely close to the original
textbook. The logic foundations of HOL makes the whole work (or individual
parts) easily portable to other theorem provers.

Further plan on the formalisation mainly includes: 1) the extension to
multi-variable equation/contractions. 2) the support of recursion operators in
CCS context and expressions.

The second author would like to thank many people from HOL community
for their help in the past two years: Michael Norrish, Thomas Tuerk, 
Ramana Kumar, Konrad Slind, and Jeremy Dawson. The second half of this
paper was written in memory of  Mike J. Gordon.
