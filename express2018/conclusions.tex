% \finish{discuss multiple equations/contractions} 

% The formalisation of multi-variable context (or expressions) and the version of
% ``unique solutions'' theorems with multiple equations/contractions, is
% a relative hard problem. To the best of our knowledge, so far there's no formalization (in any kind of
% process calculi) touching these areas yet. However, we've made a few initial steps
% of this interesting problem.
