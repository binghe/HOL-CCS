\section{Formalization}

In the second half of this paper, we present a formalization of CCS
including the new concepts and theorems proposed in the first half of
this paper. The main purpose is to convince the readers that, there's no flaw in the informal proofs. The
formalization work is based on a formalization of CCS in HOL theorem
prover (HOL4) \cite{slind2008brief}, described in second author's MSc thesis
\cite{Tian:2017wrba} and now lives in the official examples folder of HOL4 source
code\footnote{\url{https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL}}.
The work is essentially a porting and extension of the early CCS
formalization by Monica Nesi \cite{Nesi} in HOL88.

Higher Order Logic (or ``HOL Logic'') \cite{hollogic} stands for simple-typed $\lambda$-calculus plus Hibert
choice operator, axiom of infinity, and rank-1 polymorphim (type
variables). HOL4 implemented this logic without any extension, while
some other theorem provers in HOL family (e.g. Isabelle/HOL) has
various extensions. The HOL Logic is considerability simpler than logic
foundations in most other theorem provers, e.g. Coq. As a result,
formal theories in HOL can be easily migrated (sometimes even
automatically) into other theorem provers.

We will not repeat all definitions and theorems of CCS again by their
formalized versions. Instead, we just focus on several highlights in
this work, i.e.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The formalization of semantics context in $\lambda$-expressions and the theory of
  (pre)congruence for CCS;
\item The definition and uses of trace in the proof of unique solution of
  contractions theorem;
\item The proof of the hard version of ``coarsest congruence
  contained in $\approx$'' theorem.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Simplifications and Limitations}

We have only formally verified simplified forms of the unique
solution theorems introduced in the first part. This is to not only
save the formalization efforts, but also to make us focusing on the most
important part of the proof. The most important simplification is
that, we have only proved all unique solution theorems with only single-variable equations
(contractions).

But such a simplification doesn't hurt the rigorousness of our entire
work, as once the single-equation version of the theorem is
proven, the general case is just a routine
adaptation for paper proofs.
It's not easy to formalize multi-variable CCS equations with
introducing a large number of definitions and intermediate
results. It's easy, however, to directly use the semantics context to
represent single-variable equations without the need of formalizing
the concept of ``equation'' at all.

There're two major limitations in this work. One is due to HOL, we only support Finitary CCS, i.e.
no infinite sum nor infinite parallel composition.
The other limitation is, equation variables (or holes in semantics contexts)
cannot appear inside recursion operator closure. However, these limitations do not
cause any difference in the proof of main results represented in this paper.
