\section{Formalization}

We highlight here a formalization of CCS
in the HOL theorem
prover (HOL4) \cite{slind2008brief},
including the new concepts and theorems proposed in the first half of
this paper.
%  The main purpose is to convince the readers that, there's no flaw
%  in the informal proofs. 
The whole formalization can be found 
in \cite{Tian:2017wrba}  or in 
 in the official example folder of HOL4 source
code\footnote{\url{https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL}}. The
work consists of about 20,000 lines of proof scripts in Standard ML.
%  This
%  work is based on a formalization of CCS in HOL theorem
% prover (HOL4) \cite{slind2008brief}, described in second author's MSc thesis
% \cite{Tian:2017wrba} and now lives in the official examples folder of HOL4 source
% code\footnote{\url{https://github.com/HOL-Theorem-Prover/HOL}}.

Higher Order Logic (or ``HOL Logic'') \cite{hollogic} stands for simple-typed $\lambda$-calculus plus Hibert
choice operator, axiom of infinity, and rank-1 polymorphim (type
variables). HOL4 implemented the original HOL Logic, while
some other theorem provers of the HOL family (e.g. Isabelle/HOL) added
further extensions (they made the formal language more powerful,
but they also bring the possibilities that the entire logic becomes inconsistent).
The HOL Logic has considerability simpler logic
foundations than most other theorem provers, e.g. Coq. As a result,
formal theories in HOL can be easily migrated (sometimes even
automatically) into other theorem provers.

\finish{below: to be reformulated (by Davide) later} 
We will not repeat all definitions and theorems of CCS again by their
formalized versions. Instead, we just focus on several highlights in
this work, i.e.
\begin{enumerate}
\item The formalization of semantics context in $\lambda$-expressions and the theory of
  (pre)congruence for CCS;
\item The definition and uses of trace in the proof of unique solution of
  contractions theorem;
\item The proof of the hard version of ``coarsest congruence
  contained in $\approx$'' theorem.
\end{enumerate}


In contrast with the theorems in the first part of the paper, in the
formalization we consider only single equations/contractions. 
This considerably simplifies the  reading of the HOL scripts. 
The extension of the work to multiple equations/contractions is
discussed in Section~\ref{s:}. \finish{to be finished}

% \subsection{Simplifications and Limitations}

% We have only formally verified simplified forms of the unique
% solution theorems introduced in the first part. This is to not only
% save the formalization efforts, but also to make us focusing on the most
% important part of the proof. The most important simplification is
% that, we have only proved all unique solution theorems with only single-variable equations
% (contractions).

% But such a simplification doesn't hurt the rigorousness of our entire
% work, as once the single-equation version of the theorem is
% proven, the general case is just a routine
% adaptation for paper proofs.
% It's not easy to formalize multi-variable CCS equations with
% introducing a large number of definitions and intermediate
% results. It's easy, however, to directly use the semantics context to
% represent single-variable equations without the need of formalizing
% the concept of ``equation'' at all.

% There're two major limitations in this work. One is due to HOL, we only support Finitary CCS, i.e.
% no infinite sum nor infinite parallel composition.
% The other limitation is, equation variables (or holes in semantics contexts)
% cannot appear inside recursion operator closure. However, these limitations do not
% cause any difference in the proof of main results represented in this paper.
