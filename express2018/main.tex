\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
The unique solution of contractions is a proof technique for bisimilarity 
that overcomes  certain syntactic constraints of 
Milner's ``unique solution of equations'' technique.
The paper presents an overview of the
a rather  
 comprehensive formalisation  of the core of the theory of CCS 
 in the HOL
theorem prover (HOL4),  with a focus towards the theory of unique solutions of contractions.
(The
formalisation consists of about 20,000 lines of proof scripts in Standard ML.)
Some refinements of the theory itself are obtained.
In particular we remove the constraints on the occurrences of the sum operator by 
moving to 
rooted contraction, that is, the coarsest precongruence contained in the contraction
preorder.



% theorem for (rooted) weak
% bisimilarity have severe syntactical limitations, i.e.\;the
% equations must be both strongly guarded and sequential. By replacing
% equations with special inequations called ``contraction'', Sangiorgi
% has proven the ``unique solution of contractions'' theorem for weak
% bisimialarity, which requires only weakly guarded equations. However,
% contraction is not (pre)congruence under direct sums of processes.
% To overcome this difficulty, we further moved to ``rooted
% contraction'', which is the coarsest precongruence contained in
% contraction bisimilarity. Using rooted contraction one obtains an
% unique-solution theorem that is valid for 
% \emph{rooted bisimilarity} (hence also for bisimilarity itself) while
% requires true weak guardness (with direct sums). All results were
% formalized in HOL theorem prover (HOL4), as part of a rather complete
% formalisation of process algebra CCS. We show some highlights of this
% formalisation work.
