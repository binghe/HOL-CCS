\begin{abstract}
Milner's ``unique solution of equations'' theorem for (rooted) weak
bisimilarities requires severe syntactical limitations, i.e. the
equations to be both strongly guarded and sequential. By replacing
equations with special inequations called ``contraction'', Sangiorgi
proved the ``unique solution of contractions'' theorem for weak
bisimialarity, in which only weakly guardness is needed. However,
contraction is not a (pre)congruence under direct sums which are part
of standard CCS definitions. To futher overcome this difficulty, a new
concept called ``rooted contraction'' can be defined following the
idea of rooted weak bisimilarity (i.e. observational congruence). We
proved this new relation is the coarsest precongruence contained in
contraction bisimilarity, while its corresponding ``unique solution''
theorem requires only weakly guardness with direct sums and leads to
rooted weak bisimilaries for its solutions. All these results have been
formally verified under HOL theorem prover (HOL4).
