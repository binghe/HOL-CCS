\section{Introduction}

A prominent proof method for bisimulation, put forward by Milner and widely used in his
landmark CCS book \cite{Mil89} is the
\emph{unique solution of equations}, whereby two tuples of processes are
componentwise bisimilar if they are solutions 
of the same system of equations.
This method  is important in verification techniques and tools
based on algebraic reasoning \cite{BaeBOOK,theoryAndPractice}. 

In the   \emph{weak} case (when  behavioural equivalences abstract from internal moves,
which practically is the most relevant case), however, 
Milner's proof method has severe syntactical limitations. 
A way for  overcoming such limitations is to replace 
equations
 with  special inequations called
\emph{contractions} \cite{sangiorgi2015equations}. Contraction is a
preorder that, roughly, places some efficiency
constraints on processes.  Uniqueness of the solution of a system of contractions
 is defined as with systems of equations:  
any two solutions must be bisimilar.
The difference with equations is in the meaning of a solution:
in the case of contractions
the solution is evaluated with respect to
the contraction preorder, rather than bisimilarity. 
With contractions, most syntactic limitations of the unique-solution theorem can be
removed.  One constraint that still remains in
\cite{sangiorgi2015equations} is on occurrences of the sum operator,
due to the failure of the substitutivity of contraction for  such an operator.


The main goal  of the work described in this paper is 
a rather  
 comprehensive formalisation  of the core of the theory of CCS 
 in the HOL
theorem prover (HOL4),  with a focus on the theory of unique solutions of contractions.
The formalisation however is not confined to the theory of  unique solutions, but embraces 
most of the 
core of the theory of CCS \cite{Mil89}
(partly because the theory of unique solutions
 relies on a number of more fundamental results):
indeed the formalisation encompasses the basic properties of strong and weak
bisimilarity (e.g. the fixed-point and substitutivity properties), 
their basic algebraic theory, various versions of ``bisimulation up to''
techniques (e.g., bisimulation up-to bisimilarity),
the main properties  of the rooted bisimilarity (the congruence induced by weak
bisimilarity, also called observation congruence), and of the expansion preorder (an
efficiency-like refinement of bisimilarity). Concerning rooted bisimilarity, the formalisation
includes Hennessy and Deng lemmas, and two proofs that rooted bisimilarity is the largest
congruence included in bisimilarity:
one as in Milner's
book,  requiring the hypothesis that  no processes can use all labels; the other without
such hypothesis, essentially formalising van Glabbeek's paper \cite{vanGlabbeek:2005ur}
(such a proof however follows the structure of the ordinal numbers, which cannot be handled
in HOL, and therefore it is restricted to finite-state processes ).
Similar theorems are proved for the rooted contraction preorder.
In this respect,  the work is an extensive experiment with the use of the HOL theorem prover and its
most recent developments, including a package  for expressing coinductive definitions.
The
work consists of about 20,000 lines of proof scripts in Standard ML.



From the CCS theory viewpoint, the formalisation has offered us the possibility of 
further refining the theory of unique solutions. 
In particular, the existing theory  placed limitations on the body of the contractions due to the
substitutivity problems of weak bisimilarity and other behavioural relations with respect
to the sum operator.  
We have thus refined the proof  technique based on contractions by moving to  
\emph{rooted contraction}, that is, the coarsest (pre)congruence contained in the contraction
preorder.  The resulting 
 unique-solution theorem is valid for
\emph{rooted bisimilarity} (hence also for bisimilarity itself), and places no 
constraints on the occurrences of sums.   

% \finish{ I had to remove the reference \cite{Tian:2017wrba} here
% since it would further 
%   weaken this paper. } 

Another advantage of the formalisation is 
that we can take advantage of results about different 
equivalences or preorders that share a similar  proof structure. 
Examples are: the results that rooted bisimilarity and rooted contraction are,
respectively, the coarsest congruence contained in weak bisimilarity 
and the coarsest precongruence contained in the contraction  preorder; 
the result about unique solution of equations for weak bisimilarity that uses the
contraction preorder as an auxiliary relation, and other unique solution results (e.g., 
the one for rooted in which
the auxiliary relation is rooted contraction); various forms of enhancement of the bisimulation
proof method (the `up-to' techniques).  
In these cases,  moving between proofs there are only a few places in which the HOL scripts have to be modified.
Then the successful termination of the scripts  gives us a guarantee that the proof is
completed,  removing the risk 
of overlooking or missing details as in hand-written proofs. 


% to describe
% The purpose of this paper is twofold. 
% On the one hand, 
% On the other hand, we provide a  
%  comprehensive formalisation  of the core of the theory of CCS 
%  in the HOL
% theorem prover (HOL4). The formalisation  includes the proofs of
% Milner's 3 ``unique solution of equations'' theorems and
% contractions discussed in the present paper, but is not limited to it (partly because such
% theorems rely on a number of more fundamental results):
% indeed the formalisation encompasses the basic properties of strong and weak
% bisimilarity (e.g. the fixed-point and substitutivity properties), 
% their algebraic theory, various versions of ``bisimulation up to''
% techniques (e.g., bisimulation up-to expansion),
% the basic properties  of rooted bisimilarity. 
% Thus the work is an extensive experiment with the use of the HOL theorem provers and its
% most recent developments, including a facility  for expressing coinductive definitions.

% % Considering the relationship between bisimilarity and rooted
% % bisimilarity, the formalisation includes the proof that the latter is the coarsest
% % congruence included in the former, for which two proofs are formalized: one as in Milner's
% % book,  requiring the hypothesis that  no processes can use all labels; the other without
% % such hypothesis, essentially formalising van Glabbek's paper \cite{vanGlabbeek:2005ur}.
% % Similar theorems are proved for rooted contractions wrt the contraction preorder.
