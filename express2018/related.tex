\section{Related formalisation work}
\label{s:rel}

The closest of our work is Monica Nesi's \cite{Nesi:1992ve,Nesi:2017wo}. She has made
the first formalization of CCS,  using early versions of the HOL theorem prover.
% both pure CCS  and Value-Passing CCS
%\cite{Nesi:2017wo} in old versions of HOL theorem prover.
%\footnote{Part of
% the proof scripts for pure CCS now is available at \url{https://github.com/binghe/informatica-public/tree/master/CCS2/CCS-Nesi}.}. 
Her main focus is  on
 decision procedures (as ML functions) for
automatically proving bisimilarities between CCS
processes.  Her work has been a basis for ours. However, the differences are substantial,
both because we have used the most recent version of HOL, and because of the spectrum of
the theory considered.

Bengtson,  Parrow and Weber
have made a substantial formalisation work 
on CCS, $\pi$-calculi
and $\psi$-calculi 
using Isabelle/HOL and its nominal datatype package, with main focus on the handling of
name binders \cite{bengtson2010formalising,bengtson2007completeness,bengtson2007formalising}.
% Jesper Bengtson's PhD thesis 
%  \cite{bengtson2010formalising} looks  at 
% formalizations of CCS, $\pi$-calculi and $\psi$-calculi
% into Isabelle/HOL and its
% nominal logic. For CCS, 
% he has 
%  formalized
%  basic properties for strong/weak equivalence (congruence, basic
%  algebraic laws), for a  and observational
% congruence, however the CCS syntax doesn't have constants
% (or recursion operator), using replication in place of recursion.
% The formalisation effort has then been continued 
%
% On the other side, Jesper
% Bengtson and Joachim Parrow made great progress on $\pi$-calculus
% formalization and 
% proved that the algebraic axiomatization of bisimulation
% equivalence in the $\pi$-calculi is sound and
% complete. \cite{bengtson2007completeness} 
Other formalisations in this area include the work of Solange
Coupet-Grimal\footnote{\url{https://github.com/coq-contribs/ccs}} in Coq
and Chaudhuri et al.\;\cite{chaudhuri2015lightweight} in Abella. The
latter focuses on `bisimulation up-to' techniques for strong bisimilarity 
for CCS and $\pi$-calculus.
% Formalisations less related to ours
% include Kahsai and Miculan \cite{kahsai2008implementing} for the spi
% calculus  in Isabelle, and Hirschkoff \cite{hirschkoff1997full} for the $\pi$-calculus in Coq.
