\subsection{Systems of contractions}
\label{ss:SysContr}

A \emph{system of contractions} is defined as a system of equations,
except that the contraction symbol $\mcontr$ is used in the place of
the equality symbol $=$. Thus a system of contractions is a set 
$\{  X_i \mcontr E_i\}_{i\in I}$
where $I$ is an  indexing set and expressions
$E_i$  may contain the  \behavC\  variables 
$\{  X_i\}_{i\in I}$.

\begin{definition}
\label{d:uniContra}
Given a  system of contractions 
$\{  X_i \mcontr E_i\}_{i\in I}$, 
 we say that:
\begin{itemize}
\item
 $\til P$ is a \emph{solution  for $\mcontrBIS$ of the 
 system of contractions} 
 if $\til P \mcontrBIS \til E [\til P]$;
\item 
the system  
has  \emph{a unique 
solution for $\asymp$}
if 
whenever 
 $\til P$ and $\til Q$ are both solutions  for  $\mcontrBIS$
 then $\til P \asymp \til Q$.
\qed\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
  


\begin{definition}
\label{d:guarded}
A system of contractions $\{  X_i \mcontr E_i\}_{i\in I}$
 is
\emph{weakly guarded}
if,  in each    $E_i$, each occurrence of
a \behavC\ variable is underneath a prefix.

The system use \emph{weakly-guarded sums} if 
each $E_i$ only makes use of guarded sums.
\qed\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
\label{l:uptocon}
Suppose $\til P$ and $\til Q$ are solutions  for $\wb$
 of a system of weakly-guarded
contractions that uses  weakly-guarded sums.
For any context $\qct$, 
if  $\ct{\til P}\Arr{\mu}  R$,
 then 
there is a  context $\qctp$
such that $R \mcontrBIS \ctp{\til P}$ and  $\ct{\til Q} \Arcap{\mu}
 \wb \ctp{\til Q}$.
\end{lemma}
   
\finish{here a sketch of the proof (notably with the induction argument)} 

\begin{theorem}[unique solution of contractions for $\wb$]
\label{t:contraBisimulationU}
A system of weakly-guarded contractions
 that uses  weakly-guarded sums    has 
a unique solution 
 for $\wb$.
\end{theorem} 

\section{Rooted contraction and unique solution theorem for rooted bisimilarity}
\label{ss:new}

\begin{definition}[rooted contraction]
\label{d:rcontra}
Two processes $P$ and $Q$ are in the rooted contraction, written 
 $P\rcontr Q$, if
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P \arr\mu P'$ implies that there is $Q'$ with $Q \arr \mu Q'$
 and $P'\mcontrBIS Q'$;
\item $Q \arr\mu Q'$   implies that there is $P'$ with $P \Arr \mu
 P'$ and $P' \wb Q'$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
\label{t:rcontrPrecongruence}
Relation $\rcontr$ is a precongruence in CCS. 
\end{theorem}  

\finish{two proofs} 

For the unique solution result a key lemma is the following one. 

\begin{lemma}
\label{l:uptocon}
Suppose $\til P$ and $\til Q$ are solutions  for $\rcontr$ 
 of a system of weakly-guarded
contractions.
For any context $\qct$, 
if  $\ct{\til P}\Arr{\mu}  R$,
 then 
there is a  context $\qctp$
such that $R \mcontrBIS \ctp{\til P}$ and  $\ct{\til Q} \Arcap{\mu}
 \wb \ctp{\til Q}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[unique solution of contractions for $\wb$]
\label{t:contraBisimulationU}
A system of weakly-guarded contractions
    has 
a unique solution 
 for $\wb$.
\end{theorem}
