\subsection{Bisimilarity and rooted bisimilarity}
\label{ss:BiEx}

The equivalences we consider here are mainly \emph{weak} ones, in that they
abstract from the number of internal steps being performed:
\begin{definition}%[bisimilarity]
\label{d:wb}
A process relation ${\R}$ is a \emph{bisimulation} if, whenever
 $P\RR Q$, \DS{for all $\mu$} we have:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P \arr\mu P'$ implies that there is $Q'$ such that $Q \Arcap \mu Q'$ and $P' \RR Q'$;
\item $Q \arr\mu Q'$,implies that there is $P'$ such that $P \Arcap
  \mu P'$ and $P' \RR Q'$\enspace.
\end{enumerate}
 $P$ and $Q$ are \emph{bisimilar},
written as $P \wb Q$, if $P \RR Q$ for some bisimulation $\R$.
\end{definition}

We sometimes call bisimilarity the \emph{weak} one, to
distinguish it from \emph{strong} bisimilarity ($\sim$),
obtained by replacing in the above definition   the weak answer $
Q\Arcap\mu Q'$ with the strong  $Q \arr \mu Q'$.
Weak bisimilarity is not preserved by the sum operator (except for
guarded sums). For this, Milner introduced \emph{observational congruence}, also called \emph{rooted
  bisimilarity} \cite{Gorrieri:2015jt,Sangiorgi:2011ut}:
\begin{definition}%[rooted bisimilarity]
\label{d:rootedBisimilarity}
Two processes $P$ and $Q$ are \emph{rooted bisimilar}, written as $P
\rapprox Q$, if
\DS{for all $\mu$}:
%  \hl{for all $\mu\in \mathscr{L}\cup\{\tau\}$}
\begin{enumerate}
 \item  $P \arr\mu P'$ implies that there is $Q'$ such that $Q
   \Arr\mu Q'$ and $P' \wb Q'$;
 \item  $Q \arr\mu Q'$ implies that there is $P'$ such that $P
   \Arr\mu P'$ and $P' \wb Q'$\enspace.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Besides reducing the rooted bisimiarity of two processes to
the bisimilarities of their  \DS{immediate derivatives}, the
above definition also brings up a proof technique \DS{for proving  rooted
bisimiarity results  by constructing a bisimulation.}
\begin{lemma}%{(Rooted bisimilarity by constructing a bisimulation)}
\label{l:obsCongrByWeakBisim}
Given a (weak) bisimulation $\RR$, if two processes $P$ and $Q$
satisfies the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $P \arr\mu P'$ implies that there is $Q'$ such that $Q
   \Arr\mu Q'$ and $P' \RR Q'$;
\item the converse of (1) on the actions from $Q$.
\end{enumerate}
then $P$ and $Q$ are rooted bisimilar, i.e.~$P \approx^c Q$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
\label{t:rapproxCongruence}
$\rapprox$ is a congruence in CCS, and it is the
coarsest congruence contained in $\approx$ \cite{van2005characterisation}.
\end{theorem}
