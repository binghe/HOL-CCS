\begin{abstract}
  The unique solution of contractions is a proof technique for
  bisimilarity that overcomes certain syntactic constraints of
  Milner's ``unique solution of equations'' technique.  The paper
  presents an overview of a rather comprehensive formalisation of the
  core of the theory of CCS in the HOL theorem prover (HOL4), with a
  focus towards the theory of unique solutions of contractions.  (The
  formalisation consists of about 20,000 lines of proof scripts in
  Standard ML.)  Some refinements of the theory itself are obtained.
  In particular we remove the constraints on summation,
  which must be weakly-guarded, by moving to \emph{rooted
  contraction}, that is, the coarsest
  precongruence contained in the contraction preorder.

% theorem for (rooted) weak
% bisimilarity have severe syntactical limitations, i.e.\;the
% equations must be both strongly guarded and sequential. By replacing
% equations with special inequations called ``contraction'', Sangiorgi
% has proven the ``unique solution of contractions'' theorem for weak
% bisimialarity, which requires only weakly guarded equations. However,
% contraction is not (pre)congruence under direct sums of processes.
% To overcome this difficulty, we further moved to ``rooted
% contraction'', which is the coarsest precongruence contained in
% contraction bisimilarity. Using rooted contraction one obtains an
% unique-solution theorem that is valid for 
% \emph{rooted bisimilarity} (hence also for bisimilarity itself) while
% requires true weak guardness (with direct sums). All results were
% formalized in HOL theorem prover (HOL4), as part of a rather complete
% formalisation of process algebra CCS. We show some highlights of this
% formalisation work.
