\subsection{Expansions and Contractions}
\label{s:mcontr}

The constraints on the unique-solution Theorem~\ref{t:Mil89} can be 
weakened if we move from equations to a special kind of inequations called
  \emph{contractions}.

Intuitively, the bisimilarity contraction $\mcontrBIS$ is a preorder in which 
$P \mcontrBIS Q  $  holds  if $P \wb Q$ and, in addition, 
$Q$ has the \emph{possibility} of being at least as efficient as $P$ (as far as
$\tau$-actions performed). 
Process $Q$, however, may be nondeterministic and may have other ways
of doing the same work, and these could be  slow (i.e., involving
more $\tau$-steps than those performed by $P$).
% Thus, in contrast with expansion,  we cannot really say that `$Q$ is more efficient than
% $P$'.

\begin{definition}%[bisimulation contraction]
\label{d:BisCon}
A process relation ${\R}$ 
 is a \emph{(bisimulation) contraction} if, whenever
 $P\RR Q$, %for all $\mu$ 

\begin{enumerate}
\item   $P \arr\mu P'$ implies there is $Q'$ such that $Q \arcap \mu
  Q'$ and $P' \RR Q'$;
\item $Q \arr\mu Q'$   implies there is $P'$ such that $P \Arcap \mu
 P'$ and $P' \wb Q'$\enspace.
\end{enumerate}
\hl{Two processes $P$ and $Q$ are in the \emph{bisimilarity
    contraction}}, written as $P \mcontrBIS Q$ ($P$ \emph{contracts to} $Q$),
if $P\ \R\ Q$ for some contraction $\R$.
\hl{Sometimes we write $\mexpaBIS$ for the inverse of $\mcontrBIS$.}
\end{definition}

In the first clause $Q$ is required to match $P$'s challenge
transition with at most one transition.
This makes sure that $Q$ is capable of mimicking $P$'s
work at least as efficiently as $P$. 
In contrast, the second clause of Definition~\ref{d:BisCon}, on the
challenges from $Q$, entirely ignores efficiency: it is the same
clause of  weak bisimulation~---the final derivatives are \hl{indeed} required
to be related  by $\wb$, rather than by $\R$.

Bisimilarity  contraction is coarser than 
the \emph{expansion relation} $\expa$~\cite{arun1992efficiency,sangiorgi2015equations}.
This is a preorder \hl{that is} widely used in proof techniques for bisimilarity and
intuitively refines bisimilarity by 
formalising the idea of `efficiency' between processes.
Clause (1) is the same in the two
preorders. But in clause (2) expansion uses 
$P \Arr \mu P'$, rather than $P \Arcap \mu P'$; 
 moreover with
contraction the final derivatives are simply required to be bisimilar.
An expansion 
$P \expa Q$
tells us  that $Q$ is always at least as efficient as $P$, whereas  the
 contraction $P \mcontrBIS Q$  just says that $Q$ has the possibility of
being at least as efficient as $P$. 

% \iflong\newDS
% Note the use of $\wb$, in place of $\R$, in the second clause:
%  we are only interested to know that $Q$ may  mimic $P$'s
% more in an efficient manner (first clause); we do not care about
% efficiency
% on the
% challenges proposed by $Q$,   which are handled using ordinary
% bisimilarity.

\begin{definition}%[expansion]
\label{d:expa}
A process relation ${\R}$
  is an \emph{expansion} if, whenever
we have $P\RR Q$, for all $\mu$
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item   $P \arr\mu P'$ implies that there is $Q'$ with $Q \arcap \mu  Q'$
  and $P' \RR Q'$;
 \item $Q \arr\mu Q'$   implies that there is $P'$ with $P \Arr \mu P'$ and $P' \RR Q'$.
 \end{enumerate}
\hl{Two processes $P$ and $Q$ are in the \emph{bisimilarity
    expansion}}, written as $P \expa Q$ ($P$ \emph{expands} $Q$),
 if $P \RR Q$ for some expansion $\R$.
 \end{definition}

\begin{example}
\label{exa:contr}
We have %\mcontrBIS a + \tau^n . a $
 $ a \not  \mcontrBIS \tau. a$. However,
$a+ \tau . a \mcontrBIS a$, as well as its converse, 
$  a \mcontrBIS a +
\tau . a $. Indeed, if $P \wb Q$ then 
$  P  \mcontrBIS P +Q$. The last two relations do not hold with 
$\expa$, which explains the strictness of the inclusion
 ${\expa} \subset {\mcontrBIS}$. 
% The inclusion is strict: for instance
% $a+ \tau . a \mcontrBIS a$, where $\mcontrBIS$ cannot be replaced by
%  $\contr$. Also the converse of  $a+ \tau . a \mcontrBIS a$ holds, namely
% $  a \mcontrBIS a +
% \tau . a $. However, we have %\mcontrBIS a + \tau^n . a $
%  $ a \not  \mcontrBIS \tau. a$
\end{example} 

\hl{In the same way as bisimilarity, both the expansion and the
contraction preorders are preserved by all CCS operators except the
summation. The proofs are similar, see e.g.}~\cite{sangiorgi2017equations}.
